# Java-2D-drawing-interface

A simple Java interface for creating a Frame and Panel and drawing things on them, along with some methods added for convenience. It's pertty bare-bones at the moment.

Mostly I was tired of having to re-learn how interfaces and drawing worked in Java every time I had an idea for a simple game, So I decided to put this library together as a quick shortcut to all of this.

I doubt I'm using the most up-to-date classes and best practices, but feel free to use this as you see fit. Just be sure to mention me :]
